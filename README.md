# Amin Turbine
The purpose of this project is to design and build an Amin turbine.

Sanjay Amin is an american inventor who invented a turbine capable of converting the thermal energy of the air into mechanical (and thereby electrical) energy.

This apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics is not such since, as the Fluctuation Theorem proved, under certain conditions the second law does not hold.

The complete machine would comprise:

- An Amin turbine.
- A DC motor/generator. It is responsible for spinning and accelerating the turbine until enough revolutions per minute (rpm) are reached to sustain autorotation.
- A battery for powering the motor and store the excess energy when it works as a generator.
- An electronic control unit with the following functions:
  - Control the current flowing into the motor and out of the generator.
  - Control the turbine's rpm, applying a brake if necessary to prevent run-away conditions.
  - Control the charge of the battery.

Some documents describing Amin's invention can be found in the references folder.

Anyone interested in collaborating in the design and/or construction of the machine please post your suggestions through GitHub.
